- Heya guys, it's me, CommandTCF.
- As y'all should know, I'm quite a fan of Undertale and its fangames.
- The only coding platform I actually know how to use is Scratch.
- That's why I wanted to start coding here.

- Stay tuned!


- Oh yeah, and also sub to my yt and follow my scratch account (scratch is TCFOnline)
